# Simple API for word counter

This is a simple API that calculates the frequency of words in a given text input. It returns the 10 most frequent words along with their count.

## Use the API

You can use the API by making a `POST`request with raw text data.

**Example**

``` javascript
    fetch("https://simple-api-word-counter.onrender.com/count", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
        body: "Banan Ã„pple Katt Hund Banan Hund Katt Hund"
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log("Response:", data))
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

## Getting Started
